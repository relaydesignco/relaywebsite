    <template #challenge>
      <p>The original Embodied Labs product was VR-based. It required trainees to use a VR headset, and was most commonly used on-site at their employer. When the pandemic hit, customers were reticent to bring employees on-site or share headsets, and usage dropped off. Relay was tasked with helping bring the product to the web, enabling users to access the educational content remotely via their browser.</p>
